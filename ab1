Let
a+b = 1
x = 1/a
y = 1/b
c = x-1
d = y-1
S(t) = t + t^2 + t^3 + ...

Then
cd=1
x+y=xy
b/a = x-1 = x/y = c = S(b)
a/b = y-1 = y/x = d = S(a)
d/c = d^2 = (y/x)^2 = (a/b)^2
c/d = c^2 = (x/y)^2 = (b/a)^2
bx = b/a = c
ay = a/b = d
a=d/y
b=c/x

S(a).S(b) = 1
1/b = 1+S(a) = y
1/a = 1+S(b) = x
S(a)+S(b) = xy - 2

  r+r^2+r^3.. = r/(1-r)
1+r+r^2+r^3.. = 1/(1-r)
1/a+1/a^2+1/a^3+.. = 1/(a-1) -> s

m = a^4+a^3+a^2+a+1 = (a^5-1)/(a-1)
m+s = (a^5)/(a-1)  -> r = 1/a

1/(1-1/2^z)= 2^z/(2^z-1)
------------------------------
u = 1/2 + a
v = 1/2 - a

Hi Prag,

On reconstructing our conversation this morning, I could deduce the context a bit now. It seems Subodh has talked to you about my discussion with Steven and that seems to be the context. I missed that entirely.

Oh my god. This is the most interesting team I have worked with in my entire career.

First, as I told you earlier (before Subodh started on his vacation), I was reluctant to directly interact with Steven, as Alex, Steven and Amber are in this decision making role and I'm not. However, Subodh pushed me to define and ask for architecture work from Steven. Also, Subodh asked me to attend this meeting with Steven to review progress on the architecture work.

Then I was explaining an archietcture view which I asked for. Subodh probably didn't like me mentioning that we need multiple private keys while talking to nCipher service, which got Steven into thinking why all this is necessary at all.

From now on, I don't want to participate in these architectural discussions (I'm declining all the calls). Whenever Subodh provides me the archietcture document, I will review/implement it.

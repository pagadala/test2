Team,

We currently have a bit of crisis situation for dev progress in blockchain projects, due to things going in the following unplanned ways.

* Dev resource onboarding delays
* Changes in KMS team's support in Signer project
* Last minute changes in the tech approach for ILOC and Signer (due to the above)
* new tech satck/approach to be tried out (local ethereum nodes, pkcs11 etc)
* Sibos and unbelievably aggressive deadlines (2-3 weeks for ILOC and Signer)

In the view of the above, I recommend the following focus areas for the tech team, to get some progress. This is for today and the next two weeks only (Fire-fighting mode). We will continuously review and re-align.

Venkat
* get ILOC new approach working in local environment (local ethereum nodes).
* Implement ILOC business flows (service impl), as many as possible.

Amber, Rob and Niall (based on availability today and next week)
* Refactor Alex's sample code into library functions and identify any additional functions we need to build, to support the flows.
* Create json data object structures (for LC application etc) in Java (Consult Paul)
* Extend/Populate fields for JWS/JWE/AMQP messages in Alex's sample code

Alex & Sudha
* Tech approach for Signer testing (pkcs11, client-certs)
* Signer code installation and testing

Questions? Suggestions?

Team,

We currently have a bit of crisis situation for dev progress in blockchain projects, due to things going in the following unplanned ways.

* Dev resource onboarding delays
* Changes in KMS team's support in Signer project
* Last minute changes in the tech approach for ILOC and Signer (due to the above)
* new tech satck/approach to be tried out (local ethereum nodes, pkcs11 etc)
* Sibos and unbelievably aggressive deadlines (2-3 weeks for ILOC and Signer)

In the view of the above, I recommend the following focus areas for the tech team, to get some progress. This is for today and the next two weeks only (Fire-fighting mode). We will continuously review and re-align.

Venkat
* get ILOC new approach working in local environment (local ethereum nodes).
* Implement ILOC business flows (service impl), as many as possible.

Amber, Rob and Niall (based on availability today and next week)
* Refactor Alex's sample code into library functions and identify any additional functions we need to build, to support the flows.
* Create json data object structures (for LC application etc) in Java (Consult Paul)
* Extend/Populate fields for JWS/JWE/AMQP messages in Alex's sample code

Alex & Sudha
* Tech approach for Signer testing (pkcs11, client-certs)
* Signer code installation and testing

Questions? Suggestions?

I think the flow diagram on the top of the document doesn't really belong here, as no references to the diagram are made in the text below it.  ***nexus***

Also if this diagram need to be cosnidered as a dev requirement, the diagram should relate itself to the sequence diagram as most of its content seem to overlap. We also need to have a Q&A session with dev team, similar to technical design sessions we had, to digest this.

Also, I really think the wording need to be changed with regards to merkle hash and publishing of LC application.

Preferably, we should mention that the hash (fingerprint) of the LC application is what is being recorded in the DLT. We can show logs only to that effect.

Also I think we should mention that, by "Representation of LC Application", we mean an hash of the LC application content. Because a representation could mean some form of the content, while hash is not a form of the content.

ILOC POC Projects: Paln-A, Plan-B and Plan-C

There was a bit of confusion regarding what these plans are. So thought of providing some clarity as far as I knew. Please correct it if needed.

Plan-A: This is the original technical design that incuded Nexus and Signer, and separate sequence diagrams for each ILOC business flow or usecase. The preliminary dev estimates were given for this context. This is not currently taken up for development.

Plan-B: This is the modified technical design that excludes Nexus and Signer. The original sequence diagrams are replaced by the  DRAM seqeunce diagram. The vendor development team (Infosys team) has been engaged to develop this, using a modular implementation approach. The project is using agile methodology for dev sprints.

Plan-C: This is the existing DRAM project code which Alex has written for his E4 project, which should cover functionality for ILOC project as per the ILOC technilcal design (see Plan-B). The goal here is to reafactor this code into multiple reusable methods and make it run as an API service. The existing DRAM code is supposed to meet almost all of the requirements for ILOC project, so the expectation is that we can meet the ILOC target dates using this plan. Infosys team is not engaged in this. Dublin team is working on this.

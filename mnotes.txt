pascal triangle can also be arranged as a matrix
a backward diagonal in the pascal matrix is a column in the triangle
a forward diagonal in the matrix is a row in the triangle

binomial	n=k	row in the triangle and forward diagonal in the matrix
sum of terms is 2^n

simplex: nCr where n-r=k is a row or column in the matrix, diagonal in the triangle
k=1: sequence of natural integers

nCr where n-2r=k is a column in the triangle and backward diagona/l in the matrix
k=0 : main diagonal: ratio of terms ~= 4

Also, the ratio of the central number in an odd numbered row of the Pascal triangle, to the second number in the diagonal passing through the central number. If the triangle is arranged as a diagonally expanding square matrix, then the catalan numbers are the ratios of the numbers on the main diagonal, to their row or column indexes.

r! is the unit and ratio between (n+r)!/n! and r! (unit) is the simplex number.

(a+b)!/(a!b!)
a+b=k => binomial
b=k or a=k => simplex
a-b=k => C*(a+1) or C*(b+1)
2a+b=k => sums are Fibonacci terms
a=2b =>?

N = r consectuve integers starting with n
F = r consectuve integers starting with 1
Cu(n,r) is prod(N)/prod(F)
Cu(n,r) = 1 if n=0 or r=0

r=2 => Cu(n,r) is triangular number  : n(n+1)/2
r=3 => Cu(n,r) is tetrahedral number : n(n+1)(n+2)/6

b^n - a^n => it is the volme of the paint of thickness (b-a), when half of sides of a n-cube, around a vertex, are painted. The painted area can be divided into multiple regions, spiralling around the vertex, and with volumes made up by products of a and b with sum of their exponents being equal to n. When b=1 and a<1, the volumes of spiralling regions would transform from 1^(n-1) to a^(n-1). 

Also, if the n very large, a^n would be very small due to a<1, making the paint volume become equal to the volume of the entire cube, though paint thickness is small. That is - 

1 = (1-a)(1+a+a^2+a^3+...)
LHS is the entire volume of the cube (b^n), while RHS is the paint thickness (1-a) multiplied by the paint area. RHS is the paint volume while the LHS is the cube volume.

The volume of an higher-dimensinal cube, with its side<1, comes from its sides. There is nothing inside of those sides.

-----------------------
Factorial spiral

Start with a line of one unit long. Sweep it through second dimension for 2 units creating a rectangle, and then sweep the rectangle into third dimension through 3 units. Continue this process for higher dimensions using uniformly increasing lengths. The set of consecutive edges of the cuboid with uniformly increasing lengths, forms a spiral in N dimensions.

The N-volume of the cuboid is N! The r-volume of the cuboid is related to Ncr.  Let's call this as unit N-cuboid.

Instead of starting with 1 unit, start with m units for the first dimension and m+1 units for  the second dimenion etc.  What's the ratio of N-volume of this cuboid to the N-Volume of the unit N-cuboid? This could be related to catalan numbers.
